resultsPanelTitle = Yo\u0161iko Results
yoshVersion = Yoshiko Version
resolveLibPath = Resolve Yoshiko Library Path
yoshTask = Performing Yoshiko Algorithm
solution = Solution
restartNeeded = Changes only take effect after restart!
noLibTitle = Library not loaded!
noLibMessage = There is no Yoshiko Library currently loaded! You might have to specify its location.
cluster = Cluster
clusterSize = Cluster Size:
multFactor = Multiplicative Factor for SNR: 
paidCost = Paid a total modification cost of:
clusterFound = Clusters found:
deleteSolution = Do you really want to delete this solution?
warning = Warning
timeLimitILP = Use time limit for ILP (s):
timedOutTitle = Timeout
timedOutMessage = The ILP exceeded the time-limit!

nrSolutions = Number of Solutions:
redRuleChooserTitle = Reduction Rules
discardSolution = Discard
createMetaGraph = Create Meta-Graph
metaGraph = Meta Graph
showAdvanced = Prika\u017Ei/sakrij napredne opcije

libraryPanel = Library
defaultInsertion = Default insertion cost:
defaultDeletion = Default deletion cost:
switchLanguage = Plugin language
icTooltip = This value is used to determine what the algorithm pays when inserting an edge.\nExisting mappings overwrite this value.\nA higher value means that the algorithm is less likely to insert edges in order to generate a cluster.
operationMode = Operation Mode
run = Perform Algorithm
nodes = Nodes
continueTimeout = The ILP has exceeded the given time limit. Do you want to continue? (This may take a long time)
timeoutTitle = Timeout
incompleteResult = This run yielded no usable result!
optimal = Optimal Solution
notOptimal = Non-Optimal Solution
ilpMarker = ILP Properties
timeoutMarker = Timed Out
instance = Instance
gap = Gap
currentGap = [ILP] Current Instance Gap
disableMultiThreading = Disable Multithreading
yoshikoHint = Yoshiko Hint
getYoshiko = Get Yoshiko Library
noMappingHint = You haven't mapped the cost value to a column in your edge table.\nYoshiko runs significantly faster and generates better solutions if you map values.
firstStart = Thanks for using the Yoshiko Clustering Tool!\nIt appears, that this is your first time using this tool.\nIf you want an in-depth explanation of the algorithm please refer to: [INSERT COOL LINK HERE]
