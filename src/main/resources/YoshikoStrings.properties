deleteSolution = Do you really want to delete this solution?
directedGraphWarning = This algorithm works on undirected graphs. Directed edges are \n treated as undirected edges.
disableMultiThreading = Disable Multithreading
discardSolution = Discard
dualInfinityError = An edge was marked as forbidden and permanent.

editingCostPanel = Editing Costs
exportSelectedClusters = Export selected clusters
firstStart = Thanks for using the Yoshiko Clustering Tool!\nIt appears, that this is your first time using this tool.\nIf you want an in-depth explanation of the algorithm please refer to: [INSERT COOL LINK HERE]
gap = Gap
getYoshiko = Get Yoshiko Library
hideSingles = Hide single-node clusters
icTooltip = This value is used to determine what the algorithm pays when inserting an edge.\nExisting mappings overwrite this value.\nA higher value means that the algorithm is less likely to insert edges in order to generate a cluster.

multiGraphWarning = This graph is a multigraph. Running Yoshiko on the corresponding simple graph...

networkParsingException: An error occured while parsing the network:
noFeasible = No feasible solution found!
noLibMessage = There is no Yoshiko Library currently loaded! You might have to specify its location.
noLibTitle = Library not loaded!
noMappingHint = You haven't mapped the cost value to a column in your edge table.\nYoshiko runs significantly faster and generates better solutions if you map values.
